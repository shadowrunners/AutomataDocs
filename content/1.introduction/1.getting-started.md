# Getting Started

Welcome to the Automata documentation, runner! Automata is a fork of the powerful Lavalink wrapper [Poru](https://github.com/parasop/poru). This fork contains tweaks to a lot of functions and modifications to improve performance and overall make it easier to use!

If you want to get started with Automata, there is a little quick start template on the GitHub page located [here](https://github.com/shadowrunners/Automata).

If you want a full bot example, take a peak at our full-time bot project [Evelyn](https://github.com/shadowrunners/Evelyn/tree/dev) which is powered by this library.
